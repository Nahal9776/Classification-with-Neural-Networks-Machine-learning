# Classification-with-Neural-Networks-Machine-learning
◼Classify ancient cursive Japanese (Kuzushiji )writing

◼ Use Neural Networks (NN)

# The KMNIST Dataset
◼ 10 classes corresponding to 10 different characters

◼ 70’000 samples (7’000 for each class)

◼ Divided into 60’000 for training and 10’000 for testing

◼ Recent deep learning schemes can reach an accuracy of 99%

# Classification of Japanese Characters
◼ Dataset of small pictures of Japanese characters: multi class classification

◼ Use Neural Networks

◼ Try different network architectures (e.g., change number of neurons and layers)

◼ Not always the largest is the best, specially if training data is limited 

See the impact of batch size and learning rate

◼ From SGD to mini batches to standard GD

◼ SGD with single sample batch is very unstable

◼ Try with smaller or larger amount of training data

◼ Plot the estimated weights (can be difficult to see what you have learned)
